## So you wanna get some emails?

There are hundreds of posts regarding how to collect email accounts on an individual and/or company, but this post differs from the norm. We are going to focus on automation and structured outputs, that will enable us to provide consistent results!

The above image is representative of one of the tools I have written that scrapes a target website and extracts the emails from said site.

There are a few points I will be discussing here

*   API's and how useful/bad they can be

*   Understanding how the web handles emails embedded on websites

*   Data dumps and breaches

*   Understanding how to get emails, regex etc

*   Writing your own tools to fill the gaps in your collection/analysis cycle.
