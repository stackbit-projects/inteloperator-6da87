### A little gem! The Fish Shell https://fishshell.com/


**TLDR; Simpler, faster stronger bash (no Kayne West)**

****![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\*Pn8gIzc2TKWVhJiO3VUqVw.png)


A few months ago I needed a shell scripting language that suited my needs, that needed to be:

*    Faster than bash

*    Less words to type

*    Compact functions, loops and variable statements

*    Tab autocomplete; and

*    Make my life just that little bit easier (RSI).

>> So I found this gem, straight from the 90â€™s (not really); The Fish Shell
