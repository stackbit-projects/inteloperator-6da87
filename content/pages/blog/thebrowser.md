## So I always get these questions.

I'm always asked what and how I use the browser for my OSINT operations, so within this blog I will explain most of my processes. This should enable you to gain an insight into my processes and how I used them effectively.

The main points I will cover are:

*   Email collection

*   Phone collection

*   Name/user/handle/alias collection

*   Infrastructure collection; and

*   Breached data collection.
